  title: Lisk Forger API documentation
  description: |
    # Welcome!

    ## Access restrictions
    The API endpoints are by default restricted to a whitelist of IPs that can be found under `plugins.forger.whiteList` in the config.
    If it is required for your API to be accessible by the public, this can be achieved by changing `plugins.forger.whiteList` to `[]`.
    This will allow anyone to make requests to your application.

    ## Requests
    Chained filter parameters are logically connected with `AND`.
    `HTTP` is the supported URL schema by default.

    ## Responses
    The general response format is JSON (`application/json`).
    The responses for each API request have a common basic structure as shown below:
    ```javascript
    {
        "data": {}, //Contains the requested data.
        "meta": {}, //Contains additional metadata, e.g. the values of `limit` and `offset`.
    }
    ```
    ## List of endpoints
